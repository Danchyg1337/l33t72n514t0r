Translating from ENG to LEET. 
Files like 'abc.txt' it is vocabulary for program. 
For toLEET button used 'abc.txt' file. It takes random letter.
For toENG button used all others .txt files. 
Order: qwe.txt -> rty.txt -> uio.txt;
Line will be decoded in order of files.
|e€+ t2/-\^/$14t()r - input;\n
|eet t2/-\^/s1at()r - after qwe.txt;
|eet t2ans1ator - after rty.txt;
leet transiator - after uio.txt;
Pretty close to needed output. Program does not know is '1' either 'i' or 'l', so that is making inaccuracy.
